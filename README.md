The basis of what **L**esion Point C**lo**uds to **S**omatic Mu**t**ations (LLOST) was built upon.  This currently has the matlab file to create the point clouds from the The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) database.  An example dataset (example_tumor_data.mat) consisting of 41 samples Lung Adenocarcinoma is included, with each of the sample bar-codes.  The main file to run is convert_to_cloud.m which returns a new cell array that includes a point cloud representation of the lesions.

The corresponding mutations must be downloaded from The Cancer Genomic Archive (TCGA)
